### For the Glory Positions Editor

This program runs on an installation of either For the Glory or Europa Universalis II and allows a skilled user to edit the positions of sprites on the map.

This is very useful for map modders. Most players and even most modders will never need this tool.

This tool is a work in progress, based on code from before For the Glory existed. As of the initial GitHub checkin, this tool supports read/write province.csv for EU2 and read provinces.txt for FTG. Saving provinces.txt is  not yet implemented.
